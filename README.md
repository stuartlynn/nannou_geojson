## Nannou GeoJSON

This is a really quick sketch to get geojson rendering in nannou. Almost nothing about it is likley to be optimal.

To run simply 

```bash
cargo run 
```

### Todo

- [] Make a UI to controll the viewport and zoom etc 
- [] Allow a user to select what geojson they want to load 
- [] Make a UI to allow styling 
- [] Enable line's and points to be parsed / drawn 
- [] Fix border bug.
- [] Make faster
